Code
------
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.


```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Table
------
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |

| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
